### **Errors in the Code**

1. **TypeError - String Concatenation:**
   - The code attempts to concatenate a string (`"The square is: "`) with an integer (`square(5)`), which is not allowed in Python.

---

### **Corrected Code**

```python
def square(num):
    return num * num

print("The square is: " + str(square(5)))
```

---

### **Fixes Applied**

1. **Converted the Integer to String:**
   - Used `str()` to convert the result of `square(5)` to a string for concatenation.

---

### **Example Output**

```
The square is: 25
```

This corrected version resolves the TypeError and works as intended.
