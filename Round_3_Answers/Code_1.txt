### **Errors in the Code**

1. **Syntax Error - Missing Colon:**
   - The function definition `def reverse_string(s)` is missing a colon (`:`) at the end.
   
2. **Syntax Error - Missing Colon in `for` Loop:**
   - The `for` loop `for char in s` is missing a colon (`:`) at the end.

3. **Variable Name Error - `reversed_s`:**
   - The variable `reversed_s` is being used but was not declared before the loop.

4. **Logical Structure Error:**
   - There are no logical issues, but itâ€™s worth noting that this implementation of reversing a string is less efficient than using slicing (`s[::-1]`).

---

### **Corrected Code**

```python
def reverse_string(s):
    reversed_s = ""
    for char in s:
        reversed_s = char + reversed_s
    return reversed_s

string = input("Enter a string: ")
print(f"The reverse of the string is: {reverse_string(string)}")
```

---

### **Fixes Applied**

1. **Added Missing Colons:**
   - Added a colon (`:`) at the end of the function definition and the `for` loop.

2. **Variable Declaration Verified:**
   - The variable `reversed_s` is correctly declared before being used.

3. **Preserved Original Logic:**
   - Kept the original logic to ensure clarity and adherence to the user's intent.

### **Example Output**

#### **Input**
```
Enter a string: Python
```

#### **Output**
```
The reverse of the string is: nohtyP
```

This corrected version resolves all syntax issues and works as expected.
