### **Errors in the Code**

1. **Syntax Error - Missing Colon in `for` Loop:**
   - The `for` loop `for num in lst` is missing a colon (`:`) at the end.

2. **Syntax Error - Missing Colon in `if` Statement:**
   - The `if` condition `if num % 2 == 0` is missing a colon (`:`) at the end.

3. **Logical Error - Incorrect Return Placement:**
   - The `return total` statement is inside the `for` loop, causing it to return prematurely after the first iteration.

4. **NameError - Incorrect Function Name:**
   - The function is called as `sum_of_even(numbers)` instead of `sum_of_evens(numbers)`.

---

### **Corrected Code**

```python
def sum_of_evens(lst):
    total = 0
    for num in lst:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            total += num
    return total

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("The sum of even numbers is: ", sum_of_evens(numbers))
```

---

### **Fixes Applied**

1. **Added Missing Colons:**
   - Added colons (`:`) at the end of the `for` loop and the `if` statement.

2. **Moved `return` Statement:**
   - Moved the `return total` statement outside of the `for` loop to ensure all even numbers are summed.

3. **Corrected Function Call:**
   - Replaced `sum_of_even(numbers)` with `sum_of_evens(numbers)` to match the defined function name.

---

### **Example Output**

#### **Input**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

#### **Output**
```
The sum of even numbers is: 6
```

This corrected version ensures the code works as expected without syntax or logical errors.
